# The-Snake-Game
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)


rules to the game I've created: 

* snake increases its length each time it eats food.
* game ends if key 'q' is pressed.
* game restarts by updating highscore in 3 seconds after
    - snake's head encounters with it's own body.
    - snake's head encounters with the wall.
* 'UP' key turns towards NORTH
* 'DOWN' key turns towards SOUTH
* 'LEFT' key turns towards WEST
* 'RIGHT' key turns towards EAST
*
